# TomlTransformer

A tool for generating
[Toml.Transform](https://hexdocs.pm/toml/Toml.Transform.html) modules to
implement certain logic for config files

See the [distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery) and
[toml-elixir](https://github.com/bitwalker/toml-elixir) projects for more
context.

Proper documentation is forthcoming.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `toml_transformer` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
